# Haxe and JavaScript

![Haxe logo](img/haxe_javascript_logos.png) 

There used to be a website that got you started with Haxe and js (it was really old, when Haxe was spelled "haXe").

But that website is no more. I already started with HaxeNode and it seems fitting to also document HaxeJS. So I decided to get some of that back.
Based upon the information from the old site and my own need to document this.

I hope this will help. If you think so, why not help with [contribution](contribute.md) to this tutorial site.

###How will this help me?

It will get you started with JavaScript **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

###For who is this?

For clever, cool and handsom developers. Duh! :D

* Probably for JavaScript developers who already started with Haxe.
* Developers who know that JavaScript sucks for bigger projects. 
* Developers who have tried CoffeeScript and TypeScript.
* JavaScript developers who write more then a half a dozen classes.
* Flash-developers looking for an AS3 replacement
* Flash-developers starting with js and trying to compete with plain js-developers
* Freelance developers working with js
* Small developers teams working on big projects  


## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.  
That's why I use Markdown; developers use it, but is really just plane English so **everybody** can write documentation!  
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.  
Even if you are not a developer and/or don't want to clone everything, you still can modify the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).
And as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation this way, but other beat me.  
Although my idea was formed by writing a book in Markdown (Gitbook, but there are others).
Writing documentation is very similar to writing a book.
